A Miku Discord theme.

## Wallpapers
An overview with all current and past wallpapers can be found [here](https://github.com/MythikAngel/miku-discord-theme/wiki/Image-History). If the source of an image is known, it will be listed in the description. Please note that some of the images are resized or even flipped sometimes in order to make them compatible for the theme.

## Installation
Make sure the dark theme is enabled in Discord. This theme is not to be used with the light theme, and won't look any good with it.

### Discord web
Please follow [this](https://github.com/MythikAngel/miku-discord-theme/wiki/Installing-the-theme-on-Discord-web) tutorial

Alternatively you can download [Miku_theme-auto_update.theme.css](https://github.com/MythikAngel/miku-discord-theme/releases/latest) and load is as a theme in Discord client using some modifications. This way is not endorsed nor recommended.

### Customization
You can customize some colors of this theme to your own liking. See [these](https://github.com/MythikAngel/miku-discord-theme/wiki/Customizing-theme) instructions for more detail
