# Miku Discord theme

An automatically updating Hatsune Miku Discord theme. I'll change the wallpaper regularly to another picture of Miku (like at a seasonal event). This process is automatic, once installed you don't have to do anything.

### Installation
#### Discord client
1. Make sure the dark theme is enabled in Discord. This custom theme is not made to be used with the light theme, and will look terrible with it.
2. Make sure [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases/tag/0.3.0i) is successfully installed
3. Download [Miku_theme-auto_update.theme.css](https://github.com/MythikAngel/miku-discord-theme/releases) and put it in the BD themes folder (usually `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\themes` on Windows)
4. (Re)start Discord
5. Enable the theme by going to Settings > Themes
6. (_Optional_) Install [Old Title Bar](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/OldTitleBar) (theme looks better with this plugin)
7. Done. The theme should be working now and will automatically update

##### PS
I know the code is messy. I'm still a bit of a beginner at CSS, especially when I started with this theme. But it works.
