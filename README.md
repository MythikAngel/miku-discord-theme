An automatically updating Hatsune Miku Discord theme. I'll change the wallpaper regularly to another picture of Miku (like at a seasonal event). This process is automatic, once installed you don't have to do anything.

### New optional square avatars
Since the theme is becoming more popular, and not everyone seems to like the square avatars of the theme, I decided to make it an optional feature. See [these](https://github.com/MythikAngel/miku-discord-theme/wiki/Customizing-theme) instructions on how to restore round avatars.

### Installation
#### Discord client
1. Make sure the dark theme is enabled in Discord. This custom theme is not made to be used with the light theme, and will look terrible with it.
2. Make sure [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases/latest) is successfully installed
3. Download [Miku_theme-auto_update.theme.css](https://github.com/MythikAngel/miku-discord-theme/releases/latest) and put it in the BD themes folder (usually `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\themes` on Windows)
4. (Re)start Discord
5. Enable the theme by going to Settings > Themes
6. (_Optional_) [Customize](https://github.com/MythikAngel/miku-discord-theme/wiki/Customizing-theme) the colors and avatar-roundness of the theme
6. (_Optional_) Install [Old Title Bar](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/OldTitleBar) (theme looks better with this plugin)
7. Done. The theme should be working now and will automatically update
