# Miku Discord theme

An automatically updating Hatsune Miku Discord theme. I'll change the wallpaper regularly to another picture of Miku (like at a seasonal event). This process is automatic, once installed you don't have to do anything.

### How to install
1. Make sure the dark theme is enabled in Discord. This theme is not made to be used with the light theme, and will look terrible.
2. Make sure [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/) is successfully installed
3. Download [Miku_V2-auto_update.theme.css](https://mythikangel.github.io/miku-discord-theme/Miku_V2-auto_update.theme.css) (Ctrl+S if it opens as plain text) and put it in the BD themes folder (usually `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\themes` on Windows)
4. (Re)start Discord
5. Enable the theme by going to Settings > Themes
6. Done. The theme should be working now and will automatically update

(Please keep in mind that the wallpaper will change from time to time and the current wallpaper of the theme is most likely different from the wallpaper shown on the picture)

##### PS
I know the code is messy. I'm still a bit of a beginner at CSS, especially when I started with this theme. But it works.
