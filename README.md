_(114 downloads before update)_

An automatically updating Hatsune Miku Discord theme with optional square avatars. I'll change the wallpaper regularly to another picture of Miku (like at a seasonal event). This process is automatic, once installed you don't have to do anything.

### Installation
#### Discord client
1. Make sure the dark theme is enabled in Discord. This custom theme is not made to be used with the light theme, and will look terrible with it.
2. Make sure [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases/latest) is successfully installed
3. Download [Miku_theme-auto_update.theme.css](https://github.com/MythikAngel/miku-discord-theme/releases/latest) and put it in the BD themes folder (usually `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\themes` on Windows)
4. (Re)start Discord
5. Enable the theme by going to Settings > Themes
6. (_Optional_) [Customize](https://github.com/MythikAngel/miku-discord-theme/wiki/Customizing-theme) the colors and avatar-roundness of the theme
6. (_Optional_) Install [Old Title Bar](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/OldTitleBar) (theme looks better with this plugin)
7. Done. The theme should be working now and will automatically update

(Please keep in mind that the wallpaper will change from time to time and the current wallpaper of the theme is most likely different from the wallpaper shown on the picture)

### Wallpapers
An album with all current and past wallpapers can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/5wOsk). If the source of an image is known, it will be listed in the description. Please note that some of the images are resized or even flipped sometimes in order to make them compatible for the theme.
